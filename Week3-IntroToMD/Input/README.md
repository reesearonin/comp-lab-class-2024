This contains the input files necesary for each step in the tutorial. 
Step 1: Execute pdb2gmx which makes a tpology file, a position restraint file and a post-processed structure file.
Step 2: Put trp-cage in a cubic box 1nm from the box edge
Step 3: Fill the box with water
Step 4: Neutralize the charge of the system by adding ions. This part is not necessary for trp-cage because it is neutral. The output file generated by adding ions is the same as the sovated trp-cage output file.
Step 5: Minimize the energy of the protein making sure that there are no innapropriate sterics or angles. 
Step 6: Equilibrate the protein and solvent under constant particles, volume, and temperature. This will bring the temperature to the desired value of 300K.
Step 7: Equilibrate the protein and solvent under constant particles, pressure, and temperature. This will stabilize the pressure and density of the system.
Step 8: Run the 10 ns MD simulation.
Step 9: Analyze the MD simulation.
