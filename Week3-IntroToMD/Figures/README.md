Energy minimization: After processing the trp-cage protein (solvating with water), the protein is relaxed to ensure proper sterics and geometry. The graph created shows a negative potential energy that decreases, meaning that the energy minimization step was successful.
Temperature: After conducting the first phase of equilibration (constant number of molecules, constant volume, and constant temperature), the temperature should stabilize. This is shown in the graph where the temperature stays around 300 K over the 100 ps equilibration.
Pressure: After conducting the NVT equilibration, the temperature is at a steady 300 K and a constant number of molecules, pressure and temperature equilibration is conducted. The pressure fluctuates throughout the simulation, but the running average is relatively stable.
Density: The density plot was plotted after the NVT equilibration and fluctuates throughout the 100 ps equilibration The running average is plotted as well.
RMSD: This is the root mean squared deviation of the energy minimized protein. The RMSD of the crystal structure is plotted as well.
Radius of Gyration: This plot measures the compactness of the protein. This value stays within a range of 0.07 nm throughout the simulation meaning that it stays folded.
