WARNING 1 [file topol.top, line 24]:
  The following macros were defined in the 'define' mdp field with the -D
  prefix, but were not used in the topology:
      POSRES_FC_SC
      POSRES_FC_BB
      POSRES
  If you haven't made a spelling error, either use the macro you defined,
  or don't define the macro
