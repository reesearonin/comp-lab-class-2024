When aligning the AF2 and AF3 actin profilin structures and comparing the 
distances between actin residue i in both structures, there is a clear misalignment
seen in this area in PyMOL which is residues 41-51 on the bar graph made. This
area is not near the nucleotide. In PyMOL, this area is represented as a thin tube 
instead of a ribbon structure. 

It doesn't look like there is anything clearly special about the amino acids near
the uricil oxygen. Some are polar uncharged, some are negatively charged, 
some are positively charged, and some are hydrophobic. I would have expected 
all of them to be polar and able to hydrogen bond with the uricil oxygen.
